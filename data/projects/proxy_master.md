This is a script which configures removes the hassle of configuring proxy manually by supporting system wide proxy_configuration.
It is kept as simple as possible . No extra library other than the one that comes with python3 is used.

Currently tested on [Parrot Os](https://parrotlinux.org), [Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, 18.04](https://ubuntu.com).
